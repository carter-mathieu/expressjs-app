# Overview
This project is a basic user authentication and management application built in expressjs using the Prisma ORM and postgres database.

Users are able to login with an account and edit their profile, or create a profile if they do not have an account yet.

The goal of the project was to learn how to setup a user authentication process using a modular backend architecture instead of the standard model-view-controller approach, as well as how to use the Prisma ORM.
